# TANDEMLOOP Screening Test - Dhanya Dwivedi

This repository contains my solutions for the TANDEMLOOP First Screening Test.  
All programs are written in Java.

## Files Included

- **Problem_1.java** –Calculator program using a class. Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using double values.
- **Problem_2.java** – Prints the first `a` odd numbers starting from 1.
- **Problem_3.java** – Prints odd numbers according to the pattern given in the assignment.  
  If `a` is odd → print first `a` odd numbers.  
  If `a` is even → print first `a - 1` odd numbers.
- **Problem_4.java** – Takes space-separated integers as input and counts how many numbers are divisible by each value from 1 to 9.  
  Output is printed exactly in this format:  
  `{1: x, 2: y, 3: z, ..., 9: n}`
